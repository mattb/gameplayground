I'm learning cocos2d-iphone and figured I'd show my workings in public. Here's what I've done so far:

1. Started with the Xcode project template at http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2115 and cocos2d from svn (r980)
2. Used graphics from http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html
3. Tied Chipmunk physics engine into sprite. Progress video: http://flic.kr/p/6qm3e5
